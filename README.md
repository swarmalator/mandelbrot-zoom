# Zooming Mandelbrot Set

Interactive zoom and pan rendering of a colorful mandelbrot set.

## Compile (GHC)

1. Download and extract anywhere
2. Open terminal in directory containing 'mandelbrot.hs'
3. Type: runhaskell mandelbrot.hs

## Instructions

Drag and scroll the image of the mandelbrot set to view. The program
checks the ViewPort every second and regenerates the set if scrolling
or panning occured. The set becomes less defined the more you zoom
(zooming forever would require a higher maximum number of iterations
and thus longer generation times). Currently, the program keeps a constant
maximum.
